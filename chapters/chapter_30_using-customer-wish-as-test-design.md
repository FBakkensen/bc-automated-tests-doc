Test Design Chapter 4 [ 60 ] Using customer wish as test design Goal: Learn why to describe requirements in the form of a test design. A past ideal of development was a staged one, where each phase would finish before the next started.

Just like a waterfall, with water flowing from one level to the other. From requirements gathering to analyses, to design, coding, testing, and finally, operation and maintenance, each phase would have its deadlines, and documented deliverables handed off to the next phase.

One of the major drawbacks of this system is its responsiveness to changing insights, resulting in changing requirements. Another is the significant overhead of documents produced. In the recent decade or two, agile methodologies have become a general practice for tackling these drawbacks.

Introducing a test design, an extra document, to your development practice is maybe not what you have been waiting for, even though I can guarantee that your development practices will get leveraged. But what if your test design could be a kind of unified document? Being the input for each discipline in your project? The same truth shared at each level? What if you could kill five birds with one stone? If you could write your requirements in one format as input for all implementation tasks? It's a common practice to define your requirements as user stories or use cases.

But I personally think a major omission of both is that they tend to only define the sunny path and have no explicit description of the rainy scenarios. How should your feature behave under non-typical input? How should it error out? As mentioned before, this is where a tester's mind deviates from a developer's mind: how to make it break versus how to make it work.

This would definitely be part of a test design. So, why not promote the test design to become the requirements. Or inside-out: write your requirements like a test design using the ATDD pattern. This is what we are trying at my main employer now.

This is what I am advocating in my workshops and what implementation partners are picking up. Break down each wish and each feature into a list of tests like the following, and make this our primary vehicle of communication: Detailing of your customer wish 1.

Implementation of your application code 2. Structured execution of your manual tests 3. Coding of your test automation 4. Up-to-date documentation of your solution 5.
