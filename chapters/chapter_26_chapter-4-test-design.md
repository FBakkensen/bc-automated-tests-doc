4 Test Design Having had a look at the testability framework, the Test Tool, and the standard tests and libraries, I have shown you what is available in the platform and the application that will allow you to create and execute automated tests.

And that's what we are going to do in this part of this book. But let's step back and not just bluntly dive into creating code. Firstly, I would like to introduce a couple of concepts and design patterns that will allow you to conceive your tests more effectively and efficiently.

At the same time, these concepts will make your tests not just a technical exercise and will help you to get your entire team involved. I am surely not going to bother you with formal test documentation and the top-down approach with eight defined stages, from test plan, through test design/case specification to test summary report.

That's way out of the scope of this book and, not in the least, beyond the daily practices of most Dynamics 365 Business Central implementations. Nevertheless, a couple of thoughts on design spent upfront will give you leverage in your work.

The following topics will be covered in this chapter: No design, no test Test case design patterns Test data design patterns Customer wish as test design If I have been overloading you with information and you want to get your hands on coding, you might want to jump to the next chapters.

There, we will be exercising all of the things discussed so far and later in this chapter. However, if you find out you are missing background details, come back to this chapter and get yourself informed.
