Contributors About the author In 1999, Luc van Vugt stepped into the NAV world, training hundreds of developers. After Microsoft acquired Navision, he joined Dynamics localization team GDL as tester, UA specialist, and project lead.

For 6 years, he was closely involved with all successive releases. Since he left Microsoft, he has become an active community member by means of his blog. He is also co-founder of Dutch Dynamics Community and a speaker at conferences.

For this, he has been awarded MS MVP since 2011. In 2014, he co-founded NAV Skills, supporting NAV pros around the globe with, among other things, webinars. In 2012, Luc started fluxxus.nl, doing miscellaneous projects, including NAV development courses and workshops on design patterns, and automated testing.

There are many people I am thankful to, for helping me gain the knowledge that I am sharing with you – but a couple to mention explicitly here are as follows: Jan Hoek, for great discussions, his technical expertise, and support.

James Pearson and Steven Renders, for their invaluable reviews and suggestions. Nikola Kikruka and Predrag Maricic, for standing out my push toward improving standard tools and acting positively upon that.
