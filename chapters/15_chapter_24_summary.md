The Test Tool and Standard Tests Chapter 3 [ 49 ] Summary In this chapter, we discussed in a nutshell what the Test Tool is and how to use it to run your tests, or even run the collection of tests Microsoft has built and provided us with.
We gave a short overview of the various categories of tests this vast collection contains. We concluded with a brief description of the 70+ libraries containing useful helper functions to support your own test writing.
Now that we have discussed the various test features that exist in Dynamics 365 Business Central, we are ready to go and start designing and coding our own test. We will start in Chapter 4, Test Design, to introduce several design patterns that facilitate easier and consistent test case coding.
