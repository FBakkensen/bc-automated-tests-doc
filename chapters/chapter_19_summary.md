The Testability Framework Chapter 2 [ 35 ] Summary In this chapter, we discussed what the testability framework is by describing the five pillars it entails: the basic elements test codeunits and test functions, the new code keyword asserterror, handler functions to allow automatic handling of UI elements, the test runner to enable us to run tests in isolation, and, finally, test pages to build tests to check the behavior of pages.

In Chapter 3, The Test Tool and Standard Tests, you will learn about the test tool that resides in Business Central and the set of standard tests being released by Microsoft with the product.
